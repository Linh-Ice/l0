# A case study on deep search scenario

We demonstrate the general agentic capacity of the Qwen-32B model, achieved through our specialized training methodology. Cell outpus are omitted for brevity.

**Query**: Please analyze the AI for Drug Development market and provide insights on the latest trends and technologies and give me a comprehensive report on the current state of the market, including key players, emerging technologies, and potential future developments.

**Step 1:**  
ðŸ’­ Thought:
```text
To start the analysis of the AI for Drug Development market, I will first perform a web search to gather information on the latest trends, technologies, key players, and potential future developments. I will then organize the findings and create a comprehensive report.
```
ðŸ’» Code:
```python
results = web_search('AI for Drug Development market trends technologies key players potential future developments')
results
```

**Step 2:**

ðŸ’­ Thought:
```text
From the search results, we have found several valuable sources that discuss the trends, technologies, key players, and future developments in the AI for Drug Development market. Now I'll load the content of some of these sources to gather more detailed information.

I plan to load the content of these sources in markdown format and analyze them.
```

ðŸ’» Code:
```python
markdown_page = get_webpage_in_markdown('https://www.coherentsolutions.com/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology-current-trends-and-innovations')
markdown_page
```

**Step 3**  
ðŸ’­ Thought:
```text
The content of the first source is loaded. Now, I will extract the key points and relevant information from this webpage content for further analysis and inclusion in the comprehensive report. The key points will be related to trends, technologies, key players, and future developments in the AI for Drug Development market.

I need to add a plan for the next steps:
1. Extract key points from the loaded content.
2. Load and analyze additional sources.
3. Draft the report based on gathered information.
4. Review and finalize the report.

Let's update the notepad with this plan.
```

ðŸ’» Code:
```python
notepad.add_todo(['Extract key points from the loaded content', 'Load and analyze additional sources', 'Draft the report based on gathered information', 'Review and finalize the report'])
```

**Step 4**  
ðŸ’­ Thought:
```text
Now, I will analyze the loaded content and extract key points related to trends, technologies, key players, and future developments in the AI for Drug Development market.

I'll focus on these sections:
1. Current State of AI Adoption in Pharma and Biotech
2. Major Players in the Pharmaceuticals Industry
3. AIâ€™s Role in Optimizing Clinical Trials in Biopharma
4. AI in Biotechnology and Pharma Trends for 2025
5. Future Developments and Challenges

I will summarize these sections and add the key points to the notepad.
```

ðŸ’» Code
```python
notepad.add_facts([
    'AI in pharma is projected to reach $16.5B by 2034. AI is transforming drug discovery, clinical trials, and biotech innovation.',
    'Leading the pharmaceutical industry in AI adoption are "AI-first" biotech firms. Traditional pharma and biotech companies lag behind.',
    'Key companies leading the AI in the pharma industry include Pfizer, AstraZeneca, BenevolentAI, Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), Insilico Medicine, and Roche.',
    'AI is reshaping drug discovery and design by facilitating key stages and making the process more efficient, cost-effective, and successful.',
    'AI is also transforming clinical trials in biopharma by streamlining patient recruitment and optimizing trial design.'
])
```

**Step 5**  
ðŸ’­ Thought:
```text
Next, I will load and analyze another source to gain additional insights and data for the report. I'll choose the 'Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery Market Outlook Report 2025-2030' from the previous search results.
```

ðŸ’» Code:
```python
markdown_page = get_webpage_in_markdown('https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/08/3076995/28124/en/Artificial-Intelligence-in-Drug-Discovery-Market-Outlook-Report-2025-2030-Accelerating-Drug-Discovery-as-Pharma-Embraces-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Driven-Innovations.html')
markdown_page
```

**Step 6**  
ðŸ’­ Thought:
```text
Before diving into the AI for Drug Development market analysis, I need to search for the latest trends and technologies in this field. I will use the web_search function to find relevant information.

```
ðŸ’» Code:
```python
results = web_search('AI for Drug Development market trends and technologies')
results
```

**Step 7**  
ðŸ’­ Thought:
```text
Now, I need to extract key points from the search results and add them to the notepad.
```
ðŸ’» Code:
```python
notepad.add_facts([
    "AI in pharma is projected to reach $16.5B by 2034.",
    "AI is transforming drug discovery, clinical trials, and biotech innovation.",
    "Leading the pharmaceutical industry in AI adoption are 'AI-first' biotech firms.",
    "Traditional pharma and biotech companies lag behind in AI adoption.",
    "Key companies leading the AI in the pharma industry include Pfizer, AstraZeneca, BenevolentAI, Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), Insilico Medicine, and Roche.",
    "AI is reshaping drug discovery and design by facilitating key stages and making the process more efficient, cost-effective, and successful.",
    "AI is also transforming clinical trials in biopharma by streamlining patient recruitment and optimizing trial design."
])
```

**Step 8**  
ðŸ’­ Thought:
```text
I will proceed to draft the comprehensive report based on the information gathered thus far.
```
ðŸ’» Code:
```python
notepad.write_draft(
