QUALITY_ASSESSOR_PROMPT = """You are a professional data quality assessment expert, specializing in analyzing quality characteristics of question-answer datasets. Your primary responsibility is to evaluate the temporal stability and objectivity of QA pairs, providing objective professional analysis.

Please assess the following question-answer pair for temporal stability and objectivity according to these criteria:

# Temporal Stability Assessment Criteria:
- Temporal stability refers to whether the answer changes over time
- Evaluate whether the question would have different correct answers at different points in time
- Assess the persistence and stability of the information

# Temporal Stability Rating:
1 (High temporal stability): Answer does not change over time (e.g., mathematical theorems, natural laws, established historical facts)
0 (Medium temporal stability): Answer remains stable for long periods but may eventually change (e.g., geographical knowledge, infrastructure information)
-1 (Low temporal stability): Answer frequently changes over time (e.g., political positions, population data, market prices, current events)

# Objectivity Assessment Criteria:
- Whether it contains verifiable objective facts without personal opinions or emotions.
- Whether objective descriptors are used without subjective evaluations.
- Whether it involves universally agreed-upon facts that require no personal interpretation.
- Whether the answer can be independently verified.

# Objectivity Rating:
1 (High objectivity): Entirely based on verifiable objective facts
0 (Medium objectivity): Mixture of subjective judgments and objective facts
-1 (Low objectivity): Primarily based on personal opinions or value judgments

# Please output your assessment in the json format:

DIFFICULTY_ASSESSOR_PROMPT = """You are a professional educational assessment expert, specializing in evaluating the difficulty level of factual question-answer pairs in knowledge datasets. Your primary responsibility is to assess the cognitive complexity and knowledge requirements of QA pairs, providing objective difficulty ratings.

Please assess the following question-answer pair for difficulty level according to these criteria:

# Difficulty Assessment Dimensions:

## 1. Knowledge Accessibility
- Whether the required knowledge is common knowledge or specialized
- How easily accessible the information is to general audiences
- Whether multiple sources need to be consulted

## 2. Information Retrieval Complexity
- Number of facts or entities that need to be identified
- Whether cross-referencing between multiple pieces of information is required
- Complexity of the search process needed to find the answer

## 3. Reasoning and Comparison
- Whether simple recall or active reasoning is required
- Need for comparison, contrast, or relationship analysis
- Number of logical steps required to reach the conclusion

## 4. Domain Specificity
- Whether specialized knowledge in particular fields is required
- Level of expertise needed in specific domains (sports, literature, history, etc.)
- Whether technical terminology understanding is essential

## 5. Question Complexity
- Clarity and straightforwardness of the question
- Whether the question involves multiple parts or conditions
- Need to parse complex sentence structures or references

# Difficulty Rating Scale:
1 (Easy): Basic common knowledge, single fact recall, widely known information
2 (Medium-Easy): Some specialized knowledge, simple comparison, limited domain expertise
3 (Medium): Moderate domain knowledge, multi-step reasoning, cross-referencing required
4 (Medium-Hard): Specialized expertise, complex relationships, obscure information
5 (Hard): Highly specialized knowledge, complex multi-step analysis, expert-level information
